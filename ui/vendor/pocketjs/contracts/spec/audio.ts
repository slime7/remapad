// PocketJS audio spec — the boundary of the AUDIO module (`globalThis.audio`).
//
// This is a MODULE spec in the docs/RUNTIMES.md §5 sense: a vertical slice
// with its own vocabulary, mounted as its own namespace, pinned here as data.
// It is deliberately NOT part of the `ui` op table — audio evolves append-only
// in its own op space, and a host adopts it independently of the UI surface
// (capability id `audio.pcm` in contracts/spec/platforms.ts).
//
// The four parts of the boundary:
//
//   ops            guest -> core intent (numeric codes below, append-only)
//   events         core -> guest facts (per-tick batch, drained via poll())
//   data contract  PCM buffer layout + WAV pak entry layout (this file)
//   frame contract the native-audio-clock rules (below)
//
// Frame contract — the audio module owns a NATIVE-SIDE CLOCK:
//
//   The output device (sceAudio thread, AudioWorklet callback, CPAL stream)
//   runs on its own real-time clock. It never calls the guest, never blocks
//   on the guest, and never allocates on the hot path. Facts produced on the
//   audio clock (frames consumed, underrun, drain) are batched and delivered
//   to the guest ON THE TICK CLOCK: `poll()` during the guest's single
//   per-tick turn returns events describing everything up to the previous
//   tick boundary. The guest stays single-clock (law 3 holds unchanged).
//
//   Flow control is credit-based: the core grants ring space as `credit`
//   events, the guest writes PCM as `writePcm` ops. The guest mirrors its
//   free-frame budget (starts at AUDIO_RING_FRAMES, minus its own accepted
//   writes, reset by each credit event) so the hot path never queries.
//
//   Virtual-clock hosts (hosts/sim) consume EXACTLY audioFramesForTick()
//   frames per tick while a stream plays. That makes consumed PCM a pure
//   function of (tick index, op stream) — byte-exact audio traces, the same
//   determinism story as the pixel goldens.
//
// Ownership: `writePcm` BORROWS the guest buffer for the duration of the
// synchronous call — the host copies into its ring before returning, and the
// guest may reuse the buffer immediately. No shared mutable buffers, ever.
//
// If you change ANY value here: run `bun contracts/spec/gen-rust.ts`, commit
// the regenerated engine/core/src/spec.rs (tests/contract.ts byte-compares).

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Audio ops (the `audio.*` native contract)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Numeric codes are the FFI ABI identity of each op. 0 is reserved
// (invalid/nop). Codes are append-only: never renumber, never reuse.
//
// Signatures (authoritative; hosts marshal them however they like):
//   createStream(sampleRate:u32, channels:u32) -> handle | -1
//                    [rate must be in AUDIO_RATES, channels 1|2; -1 = refused
//                     (bad format or AUDIO_MAX_STREAMS live streams already)]
//   destroyStream(handle)                 [stops output, frees the ring]
//   writePcm(handle, pcm:ArrayBuffer) -> framesAccepted:i32
//                    [interleaved s16 LE frames at the stream rate; BORROWED
//                     for the call. Accepts min(free ring space, frames);
//                     the guest budgets via credit so partial accepts mean a
//                     racing flush, not an error]
//   play(handle)                          [start consuming on the audio clock]
//   pause(handle)                         [stop consuming; ring is kept]
//   stop(handle)                          [pause + flush the ring]
//   setVolume(handle, volume:f64)         [0..1, applied on the audio clock]
//   endStream(handle)                     [no more writes will come: when the
//                                          ring drains, the stream auto-pauses
//                                          and emits one `ended` event]
//   poll() -> string | undefined          [drain ONE queued event per call
//                                          (svcPoll convention); undefined =
