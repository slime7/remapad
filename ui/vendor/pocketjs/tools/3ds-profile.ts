/**
 * Transitional Nintendo 3DS profile used only by `bun run 3ds`.
 *
 * The CIA has passed a hardware smoke on a New 3DS LL. It deliberately stays
 * out of the production `POCKET_TARGETS` registry while the host-specific
 * suite still leaves the synthesized cursor, sprite, streamed-texture and
 * large-atlas paths uncovered. The app owns the 400x240 top screen and a
 * simultaneous 320x240 auxiliary bottom-screen output. Both PICA200 targets
 * are native at density 1. The resistive panel reports contacts only through
 * input.touch.auxiliary.
